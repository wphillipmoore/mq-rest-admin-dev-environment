# Release 1.1.0 (2026-02-21)

## CI

- **auto-add issues to GitHub Project (#16)**
- **add CI workflow with docs-only detection and shellcheck (#22)**
* ci: add CI workflow with docs-only detection and shellcheck

Add ci.yml with docs-only detection, standards-compliance (cutoff 903b020), and shellcheck jobs. Bump checkout@v4 to @v6 in trivy-image.yml.


## Documentation

- **add full README and mark pymqrest migration complete**
Expand README from placeholder to comprehensive developer guide
covering environment contract, seed objects, lifecycle scripts,
CI composite action usage, and local development workflow. Update
open-decisions.md to reflect pymqrest migration completion (PR #214).

- **update self-references after repository rename (#18)**
Rename all internal mq-dev-environment references to
mq-rest-admin-dev-environment following the Phase 2 repository rename.

- **ban MEMORY.md usage in CLAUDE.md (#28)**
Add auto-memory policy requiring agents to discuss behavioral rules with the human rather than storing them in unmanaged MEMORY.md files.

- **ban heredocs in shell commands (#29)**
Add explicit ban on heredocs for multi-line CLI arguments. Always use temp files instead.


## Features

- **add repository scaffolding and design decisions (#1)**
* feat: add repository scaffolding and design decisions

Bootstrap CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and repository standards following the
same dual-file documentation strategy as pymqrest and mq-rest-admin.
Document repository design decisions including consumption model (sibling
directory + CI workflow), seed data strategy (shared base), and
environment contract (QM1/QM2, ports, credentials).

- **migrate Docker config and lifecycle scripts from pymqrest (#4)**
Copy MQ environment files from pymqrest/scripts/dev/ into their
canonical locations (config/, seed/, scripts/) with path and naming
adjustments per the environment contract: mq-dev-net network,
mq-dev-qm1/mq-dev-qm2 containers, updated compose-file and seed-file
references in all lifecycle scripts. PYMQREST.* object prefixes
retained per open-decisions.md.

- **rename PYMQREST.* object prefix to DEV.* (#7)**
Make the shared MQ environment repo-neutral by replacing all
PYMQREST.* object names, descriptions, comments, and topic strings
with the DEV.* prefix. Both pymqrest and mq-rest-admin will use
these shared objects for integration testing.

- **add setup-mq composite action for CI consumption (#9)**
Provide a reusable GitHub Actions composite action at
.github/actions/setup-mq/ that starts QM1+QM2 containers, seeds
shared test objects, and optionally verifies the environment.
Consuming repos reference it as a single `uses:` step.

- **parameterize docker-compose for per-project isolation (#12)**
Remove hardcoded container_name and network name, parameterize host
ports via env vars (QM1_REST_PORT, QM2_REST_PORT, QM1_MQ_PORT,
QM2_MQ_PORT), and add COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME support. This allows
multiple consuming projects to run distinct MQ containers
simultaneously without port or naming collisions.

All env vars default to current values for backward compatibility.

- **add weekly Trivy container image scan**
Scans the IBM MQ vendor image (icr.io/ibm-messaging/mq:latest) weekly
with advisory-only exit code. Results upload to the GitHub Security tab
via SARIF. Also supports manual dispatch.

Ref mq-rest-admin-common#11, #24

- **add category prefixes to job names (#27)**
Standardize job display names with category prefixes so checks cluster naturally in the GitHub status list.

- **adopt validate_local.sh dispatch architecture (#30)**
* feat(validate): adopt validate_local.sh dispatch architecture

Add primary_language: shell to repo profile. Sync validate_local.sh driver and language-specific scripts from standard-tooling.

- **add publish workflow for automated tagging and version bumps (#36)**
* chore: add VERSION file at 1.1.0
