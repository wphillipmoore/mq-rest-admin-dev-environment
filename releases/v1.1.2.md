Add Setup and Reference nav sections to mkdocs.yml. Replace inline env vars in development.md with link to dedicated page.

- **add Releases nav section to documentation site (#57)**
Add Releases tab (Changelog + Release Notes) as the second nav entry after Home, consistent with mq-rest-admin-common and language repos. The docs-deploy action populates changelog.md and releases/index.md at build time.
